<p>Joshua Dimasaka is a registered Filipino civil engineer and a postgraduate researcher at the UKRI EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in the Application of Artificial Intelligence to the study of Environmental Risks (AI4ER), where he is pursuing fully-funded MRes+PhD degrees at the University of Cambridge. He received his BS in Civil Engineering from the University of the Philippines and his MS in Civil & Environmental Engineering and his MA in Public Policy from Stanford University.<br><br>

His current research interests focus on the intersection of engineering, policymaking, and artificial intelligence to shape an equitable disaster-resilient future amidst the pressing need to adapt to intensifying effects of climate change and other natural hazards. He worked for Stanford LBRE and the local government of Quezon City (Philippines) to support data-driven policies to manage earthquake risks. At Stanford, he worked with US Geological Survey to use machine learning on NASA satellite imagery products to improve PAGER, a global real-time earthquake hazard and loss estimation system. He is a recipient of the Stanford Knight-Hennessy Graduate Fellowship, 2018 BPI-DOST Science Award, 2017 3rd MOCES PICE National Award, and DOST & RSFI Undergraduate Scholarships.</p>
