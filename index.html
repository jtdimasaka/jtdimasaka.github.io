<p>Joshua Dimasaka is a registered Filipino civil engineer and a postgraduate researcher at the <a href="https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/">UKRI EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in the Application of Artificial Intelligence to the study of Environmental Risks (AI4ER)</a>, where he is pursuing fully-funded MRes+PhD degrees at the University of Cambridge to explore how AI can provide an improved understanding of the global resilience in response to intensifying effects of climate change and other natural hazards. He received his BS in Civil Engineering (2018) from the University of the Philippines and his MS in Civil & Environmental Engineering (2022) and MA in Public Policy (2022) from Stanford University. He also took up an Executive Education Certificate in Entrepreneurship and Innovation (2021) at Stanford Graduate School of Business.<br><br>

He recently worked for Stanford LBRE as a risk consultant to <a href="https://emi-megacities.org/about-us#:~:text=Dr.%20Fouad%20Bendimerad,Chairman">Dr. Eng. Fouad Bendimerad</a> and the local government of Quezon City (Philippines) as an <a href="https://emi-megacities.org/projects#qccdra">EMI Urban Resilience Fellow</a> to support data-driven policies to manage earthquake risks of over 400,000 buildings. At Stanford, he worked with US Geological Survey to use machine learning on NASA satellite imagery products to improve PAGER, a global real-time earthquake hazard and loss estimation system. He is a recipient of the <a href="https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/people/joshua-dimasaka">Stanford Knight-Hennessy Graduate Fellowship</a>, <a href="https://uplb.edu.ph/research/uplb-ceat-students-win-bpi-dost-science-awards/">2018 BPI-DOST Science Award</a>, 2017 3rd MOCES PICE National Award, and DOST & RSFI Undergraduate Scholarships.<br><br>
