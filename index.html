<p>Last Sep 20, our father sufferred <b>four brain aneurysms</b> (very rare) and was rushed to the Laguna Doctors Hospital, a private hospital in Southern Tagalog, Philippines, where access to neurologists has been very limited. Last Oct 6, due to worsening complications in the arteries in his lungs, our father sadly passed away. From our humble beginnings of being a low-income family whose tricycle driving used to be our primary income while living in an informal settlement in the small town of Paete, Laguna, my family has always been my source of inspiration in pursuing education from UPLB, Stanford, and Cambridge, all through scholarships and hard work (check <a href="https://www.joshuadimasaka.com/bio/">BIO</a> to learn more about our story). This unexpected medical emergency has put a huge financial strain on our family, <b>amounting to around PHP 2.6 million (GBP 33,400 or USD 44,700)</b>, which is far beyond our means. We would be deeply grateful for any support you can extend <a href="https://www.joshuadimasaka.com/donationdrive/">by donating through any of our domestic and international bank accounts.</a></p> -->

      <li><i>Oct 8, 2025</i> - I wrote a personal reflection essay <i>'Connecting the Dots of Vulnerability: The Story of a Filipino Wood Carver and Tricycle Driver’s Son — from a Laguna Lake Squatter Settlement to UP, Stanford, and Cambridge'</i> about our family's struggle in light of September's Brain Aneurysm Awareness Month.

      <li><i>Sep 21, 2025</i> - Understanding the risks and impacts of disasters is not just an academic topic -- it goes beyond theory and affects the lives of many hardworking people <i>na lumalaban nang patas at may dangal</i>. As someone who used to wade through waist-deep floods just to access education in our rural area, today is a very important moment to join our fellow Filipinos in the <a href="https://x.com/hashtag/TrillionPesoMarch">#TrillionPesoMarch</a>. Follow my undergraduate organization (CEO)'s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CEO2000/posts/pfbid02uyiRpZvTu4tcqCoHfW53YAZu2Kfpw4XN3ww5Ridsa6sscMCyPSq2oTv7Fp6tN6Wkl">series of posts for some informative explainer</a>!</a>

      <li><i>Sep 19, 2025</i> - Before this week ends, we are happy to share with you all that I have been selected as one of the 20 awardees to receive the prestigious <a href="https://digitalgreentalents.de/">"Digital GreenTalents – High Potentials in Sustainable Development" Award 2025</a> by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) "for highly motivated and talented young scientists from all over the world to find solutions to urgent issues and contribute to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)". See you in 2026, Germany!</a>
      </li>

      <li><i>Sep 1, 2025</i> - In the years following a disaster, do affected communities reduce their future risk by avoiding the construction of vulnerable structures, or do they rather return to settle in pre-identified danger zones, even after experiencing their devastating impacts firsthand? Examining the spatiotemporal changes in physical vulnerability by applying advanced machine learning to satellite-derived datasets with prior expert belief systems, the arXiv copy of our work "GraphCSVAE: Graph Categorical Structured Variational Autoencoder for Spatiotemporal Auditing of Physical Vulnerability Towards Sustainable Post-Disaster Risk Reduction", accepted at IDRC 2025, is now available <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.10308">here.</a>
      </li>

      <li><i>Sep 13, 2025</i> - Last 10th of September was our <a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-suicide-prevention-day/2025">'World Suicide Prevention Day'</a>, and it's very important for our leaders today in academia and industry to recognize their role in "changing the narrative on suicide (and, in general, mental wellbeing)" in their workplace. To celebrate this day, I'm happy to share that I've reached my 30,000 pushups that greatly helped my mental wellbeing! Also, feel free to check out my new website tab here <a href="https://www.joshuadimasaka.com/wellbeing/">'WELLBEING'</a> that contains my recently read self-help books! It's both beneficial for ourselves as we become leaders in our own career, and how we could help others by creating 'listening spaces' for many 'tender conversations'.

      <li><i>Aug 18, 2025</i> - Our short volunteering work to understand Myanmar-Thailand earthquake damage has been featured on the Department of Engineering website. Even though our volunteering capacities are sadly limited, we have truly learned a lot from this educational experience "what it's like in this very unique setting, very urgent, no data availability, and any other problems that we may have".

      <li><i>Aug 5, 2025</i> - If "DeepC4" is for "spatial auditing" from our first year, we now present our efforts towards "spatiotemporal auditing" from our second year, with a non-peer-reviewed preprint <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2508.01310">"GraphVSSM: Graph Variational State-Space Model for Probabilistic Spatiotemporal Inference of Dynamic Exposure and Vulnerability for Regional Disaster Resilience Assessment"</a> now available on arXiv! Across our three case studies ranging from city-level to multi-country scale, our proposed novel GraphVSSM tackles the equally important yet uniquely challenging aspect of modeling physical vulnerability at large spatiotemporal scales. It uniquely integrates graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a coarse-to-fine-grained manner, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data analysis in weakly supervised settings. <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2508.0131">Read the preprint here.</a>
      </li>

      <li><i>Jul 31, 2025</i> - Our non-peer-reviewed preprint <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.22554">"DeepC4: Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering for Large-scale Multitask Disaggregation of Urban Morphology"</a> is now available on arXiv! This work is the highlight contribution of my first-year PhD, which deals with "spatial auditing". Our proposed novel DeepC4, a deep constrained clustering model, advances the existing classical spatial disaggregation techniques using deep learning and EO data to understand the distribution of various urban morphology characteristics at large scales, using cluster-level constraints, multitask optimization, and multilabel conditionality, under a weak supervision setup. <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.22554">Read the preprint here.</a>
