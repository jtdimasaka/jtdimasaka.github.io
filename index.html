<p>Joshua Dimasaka is a registered Filipino civil engineer and a postgraduate researcher at the <a href="https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/">UKRI EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in the Application of Artificial Intelligence to the study of Environmental Risks (AI4ER)</a>, where he is pursuing fully-funded MRes+PhD degrees at the University of Cambridge. He received his BS in Civil Engineering from the University of the Philippines and his MS in Civil & Environmental Engineering and his MA in Public Policy from Stanford University.<br><br>

He recently worked for Stanford LBRE as a risk consultant to <a href="https://emi-megacities.org/secretariat/">Dr. Eng. Fouad Bendimerad</a> and the local government of Quezon City (Philippines) as an <a href="https://emi-megacities.org/internships/">EMI Urban Resilience Fellow</a> to support data-driven policies to manage earthquake risks of over 400,000 buildings. At Stanford, he worked with US Geological Survey to use machine learning on NASA satellite imagery products to improve PAGER, a global real-time earthquake hazard and loss estimation system. He is a recipient of the <a href="https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/people/joshua-dimasaka">Stanford Knight-Hennessy Graduate Fellowship</a>, <a href="https://uplb.edu.ph/research/uplb-ceat-students-win-bpi-dost-science-awards/">2018 BPI-DOST Science Award</a>, 2017 3rd MOCES PICE National Award, and DOST & RSFI Undergraduate Scholarships.</p>
