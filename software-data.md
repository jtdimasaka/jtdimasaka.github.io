		<b>2023 Mw-7.8 Turkey-Syria Earthquake Building Damage Estimates via Causal Inference from Satellite Imagery</b>: [Xu, S., Zhao, X., Li, X., Dimasaka, J., Zhang, X., Yu, X., Wang, C. Hu, X., and Noh, H.Y.] Building damage estimates in key areas (Hatay, Kahramanmaras, Gaziantep, Kirikhan, Nurdagi) for the 2023 Mw-7.8 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence. The assessment is conducted based on Damage proxy maps generated by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory ARIA team and Dr. Sang-ho Yun from EOS derived from Sentinel-1 InSAR imageries, prior landslides and liquefaction models generated by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Ground Failure products, and our VBCI algorithm in our recent Nature Communications paper (https://rdcu.be/c5HT8). The work is led by Dr. Susu Xu's team from State University of New York at Stony Brook (with Ph.D. students Xuechun Li and Chenguang Wang), Dr. Xie Hu's team (Peking University), Dr. Xilei Zhao's team (University of Florida), Joshua Dimasaka (University of Cambridge), Dr. Haeyoung Noh (Stanford University), Dr. Paula M. Burgi and Dr. David J. Wald from USGS NEIC.<br>

		<b>Variational Causal Bayesian Inference for Seismic Multi-hazard and Impact Estimation from Satellite Images</b>: [Xu, S., Dimasaka, J., Wald, D.,	Noh, H.] Inputs are rasterized building footprints from OpenStreetMap, USGS ground shaking maps, prior models of landslide and liquefaction, and NASA Damage Proxy Maps derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar.; Outputs are posterior models of building damage, landslide, and liquefaction.; Groundtruth are publicly available datasets of geotagged observations.; Case studies are 2016 Central Italy Mw-6.2 earthquake, 2018 Hokkaido Mw-6.6 earthquake, 2019 Ridgecrest Mw-7.1 earthquake, and 2020 Puerto Rico Mw-6.4 earthquake.<br>

		<b>Probabilistic Earthquake Risk and Loss Estimation of the Greater Metro Manila Area, Philippines</b>: [Dimasaka, J., Baker, J.] Exposure Inputs are 2014 GMMA-RAP exposure dataset of land use, building inventory, structural typology, and estimated building valuation.; Hazard Inputs are OpenQuake probabilistic seismic hazard analysis for varying return periods (100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 years) and VS30 soil map.; Fragility and Vulnerability Inputs are from HAZUS and UPD-ICE methodology.; Risk Outputs are regional damage states of over 1,750 local administrative zones; Annualized economic loss, casualty estimates (slight, severe, life-threatening, and fatalities), and damaged floor area for varying levels (none, slight, moderate, extensive, complete without collapse, and complete with collapse).<br>
