<p>Joshua believes that there is a hidden gem in the province, in the mountains, and in the remote, under-resourced, and marginalized areas... a gem, when given a voice, could make a long-lasting impact for decades. Since 2012 at age 15, he has been an advocate of widening the access to education. Raised by a low-income family while living in an informal settlement along the shore of Laguna Lake in the Philippines, he has witnessed countless times when the lake caused waist-deep flooding, and has worked with various organizations that hone his leadership service to his own community. This has been his motivation why he studied MA in Public Policy at Stanford University, where he took up graduate classes in political analysis, economic analysis of law, economic policy analysis, applied econometrics, justice in public policy, and equitable land use planning. He recently completed his MA thesis on the <a href="https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:kd110gb2567/ma_thesis_dimasaka_2022.pdf">"Equitable Development of the Regional Earthquake Resilience of the Greater Metro Manila Area, Philippines"</a> and worked with <a href="https://emi-megacities.org/">EMI Philippines</a> in assisting the Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office of Quezon City for a city-wide climate and disaster risk assessment.</p><br>
