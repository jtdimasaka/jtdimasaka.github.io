*Maraming salamat sa pagbisita!*

If you are interested to know more about the following topics, feel free to send a message (in Filipino or English) to my email - [**jtd33@cam.ac.uk**](mailto:jtd33@cam.ac.uk).

- **[Collaboration with [the Cambridge Risk Audit Project](https://riskaudit.github.io/)]** My team is always looking for stakeholders such as local disaster risk managers, researchers, and organizations (especially from underrepresented and high-risk countries). Our aim is to meaningfully understand and highlight the stories of least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and Small Island Developing States, which all have faced difficulties in implementing Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 targets. 

- **[Public Speaking Engagement]** For the past years, I have shared our stories and presented our projects to thousands of attendees. Some of these continued even after the event - 1. I was interviewed by TV Patrol Southern Tagalog about my college valedictory address in 2018. 2. My college induction speech for new engineering students of UPLB was also required for the students of UPLB National Service Training Program in 2020. 3. I gave an opening message in front of over 1,500 attendees during the National Engineering Congreess in 2017. Feel free to connect with me if your organization would like to discuss any public speaking opportunities for your events!

- **[Professional Consulting]** With diverse technical understanding of civil engineering (BS, MS), public policy (MA), business (Executive Education), and data science (MRes), I sometimes accept job opportunities (e.g., summer internships or extended part-time consulting). You may check my previous projects on my CV or LinkedIn, and send me an email to discuss any potential consulting projects.

- **[Q&A re: Stanford Knight-Hennessy Scholarship]** As an admission ambassador, I can answer your questions or inquiries (especially, if it's not clearly explained on our website). I highly recommend checking our [Events Page](https://apply.knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/portal/admission-events) for various opportunities to engage with our admission team and scholars (*I sometimes join when/if I'm free*).
